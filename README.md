# ðŸ’« About Me:
Greetings,

I am Peter, a seasoned game programmer with a lifelong dedication to crafting immersive gaming experiences. My expertise lies in programming languages such as C# and C++, along with a deep understanding of Unreal Engine. I possess an unwavering enthusiasm for learning and embracing new challenges within the field.

Presently, I am engaged in a groundbreaking endeavor aimed at redefining the entire massively multiplayer online (MMO) genre. The prospect of pursuing this project as a potential future career fills me with tremendous excitement. I wholeheartedly welcome feedback and seek collaborative opportunities, encouraging you to explore the project and share your thoughts.

I am particularly enthusiastic about collaborating on new game projects that place a strong emphasis on compelling storytelling and narrative. If you have a project underway and believe that my skills align well with your vision, I invite you to reach out, and we can discuss further.

While I possess confidence in my abilities as a game programmer, I recognize the value of seeking assistance in areas where I may require support. Currently, I am in need of assistance with assets and animations.

I firmly believe in the ethos of continuous learning and improvement. At present, my primary focus revolves around constructing foundational game systems to serve as a robust framework for future development. Moreover, I am keen on exploring alternative game engines. If you possess any valuable resources or recommendations in this regard, I would greatly appreciate your input.

Should you have any inquiries concerning Unreal Engine, my ongoing project, or any other topic pertaining to game development, I am delighted to engage in conversation. Feel free to ask questions, as I am always enthusiastic about discussing game development and sharing my knowledge and experiences.

Additional Information:

I hold a black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
Currently, I am employed in the IT sector.
In the past, I enjoyed a semi-professional career as an esports player in Counter-Strike.
Thank you, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
